# Diffusion-Models-
In this repo, I have worked with different diffusion models in order to generate some realistic images.
Diffusion models are the ones in which we can generate realistic images with prompts that we can adjust according to our needs
I have used and tested different models like SDXL, Juggernaut XL, and others.
Plus, I have added some of the images that i have generated with these models.
